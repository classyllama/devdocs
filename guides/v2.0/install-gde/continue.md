## Let's get started!
This Installation Guide helps you install the Magento software on a server that doesn't have Magento installed already. (Not sure? Go <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/basics/basics_magento-installed.html">here</a> first.)

## High-level installation roadmap

We've broken down instructions for installing the Magento software into the following groups. We suggest you follow these in order, although you can install optional sample data before or after you install the Magento 2 system itself.

By the way, if you're new to Magento installation or you don't know what some of these options means, you can <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/back-intro.html">go back to the installation overview</a>. We have some helpful information there to get you started.

1.	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/system-requirements.html">Magento system requirements</a>
2.	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/prereq/prereq-overview.html">Prerequisites</a>
3.	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/pre-install.html">Identify your installation path</a>

<h2 id="install-overview-all">Overview of installing, managing, and upgrading Magento</h2>
The Magento software enables you to install, manage, and upgrade the core software itself and any *component* you installed. A component can be:

*	A module (code that extends the Magento application in some way)
*	A language package (used to localize your Admin or storefront)
*	A theme (used to change the look of your Admin or storefront)
*	A library (common code)

You can think of it as a three-step process&mdash;where steps 2 and 3 are interchangeable:

1.	Install the Magento software
2.	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/compman-start.html">Manage components</a> (install, uninstall, update, enable, or disable)
3.	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/upgrader/upgrade-start.html">Upgrade</a> the Magento software or components to a newer version

#### Next step
We recommend you continue with <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/pre-install.html">Your install or upgrade path</a>.
