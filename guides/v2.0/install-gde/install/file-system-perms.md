#### Next steps
Install the Magento software:

*	Using the web-based <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/web/install-web.html">Setup Wizard</a>, which is better for less experienced users or anyone who has a hosting provider (especially if you don't have access to the Magento server)
*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/cli/install-cli.html">Command line</a>, which gives you more control but requires more experience and also access to the Magento server
