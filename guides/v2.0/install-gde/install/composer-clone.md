<h2 id="instgde-prereq-compose-install">Install Composer</h2>

First, check  if Composer is already installed: 

In a command prompt, enter any of the following commands:

*	`composer --help`
*	`composer list --help`

If command help displays, Composer is already installed; in that case, you can skip the next section and continue with <a href="#instgde-prereq-compose-clone">Clone the Magento repository</a>.

If an error displays, use the following steps to install Composer.

To install Composer:

1.	Change to or create an empty directory on your Magento server.

2.	Enter the following commands:

	<pre>curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer</pre>

	For additional installation options, see the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/" target="_blank">Composer installation documentation</a>.

<h2 id="instgde-prereq-compose-clone">Clone the Magento repository</h2>
This section discusses how to get current code by cloning the Magento GitHub's develop branch. You can clone either the `master` or `develop` branch:

*	`master` is more stable (we recommend this branch unless you're contributing code to the Magento 2 project)
*	`develop` is more recent

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  <p>You can now use <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/sample-data.html">optional sample data</a> with the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>
</div>

You can clone the Magento 2 GitHub repository using either SSH or HTTPS protocols:

*	Use SSH for better security (no user name and password are exchanged). This requires you to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/" target="_blank">share a public key</a> with GitHub.
*	Use HTTPS if you don't share an SSH key with GitHub (your user name and password are encrypted before being sent to GitHub).

See one of the following section:

*	<a href="#instgde-prereq-compose-clone-ssh">Clone with SSH</a>
*	<a href="#instgde-prereq-compose-clone-https">Clone with HTTPS</a>

<h3 id="instgde-prereq-compose-clone-ssh">Clone with SSH</h3>

To clone the Magento GitHub repository using the SSH protocol:

1.	Copy to the clipboard the Magento GitHub repository SSH clone URL.

	a.	In a web browser, go to <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2" target="_blank">the Magento GitHub repository</a>.

	b.	On the right side of the page, under the *clone URL* field, click **SSH**.

	c.	Click the **Copy to clipboard** button.

	The following figure shows an example.

	<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}common/images/install_mage2_clone-ssh.png" alt="Clone the Magento GitHub repository using SSH"></p>

1.	Change to your web server's docroot directory.

	Typically, for Ubuntu, it's `/var/www` and for CentOS it's `/var/www/html`.

	Need help locating the docroot? Click <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/basics/basics_docroot.html">here.

2.	Enter `git clone` and paste the value you obtained from step 1.

	An example follows:

		git clone [-b master] git@github.com:magento/magento2.git

	Use `-b master` to clone the master branch; omit it to clone the `develop` branch, which is the default.

3.	Wait for the repository to clone on your server.

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
		<p>If the following error displays, make sure you <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/" target="_blank">shared your SSH key</a> with GitHub: </p>
			<pre>Cloning into 'magento2'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</pre>
	</div>

4.	Continue with <a href="#instgde-prereq-compose-access">Set file system ownership and permissions</a>.

<h3 id="instgde-prereq-compose-clone-https">Clone with HTTPS</h3>

To clone the Magento GitHub repository using the HTTPS protocol:

1.	Copy to the clipboard the Magento GitHub repository HTTPS clone URL.

	a.	In a web browser, go to <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2" target="_blank">the Magento GitHub repository</a>.

	b.	On the right side of the page, under the *clone URL* field, click **HTTPS**.

	c.	Click the **Copy to clipboard** button.

	The following figure shows an example.

	<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}common/images/install_mage2_clone-https.png" alt="Clone the Magento GitHub repository using HTTPS"></p>

1.	Change to your web server's docroot directory.

	Typically, for Ubuntu, it's `/var/www` and for CentOS it's `/var/www/html`.

2.	Enter `git clone` and paste the value you obtained from step 1.

	An example follows

		git clone [-b master] https://github.com/magento/magento2.git

	Use `-b master` to clone the master branch; omit it to clone the `develop` branch, which is the default.

3.	Wait for the repository to clone on your server.

4.	Continue with the next section.

<h2 id="instgde-prereq-compose-access">Set file system ownership and permissions</h2>
The following sections discuss how to set file system ownership and permissions:

*	<a href="#install-perms-import">Why we recommend you set file system permissions</a>
*	<a href="#install-perms-set">File system permissions and ownership</a>

<h3 id="install-perms-import">Why we recommend you set file system permissions</h3>
{% include install/file-system-perms1-why.html %}

<h3 id="install-perms-set">File system permissions and ownership</h3>
{% include install/file-system-perms2-how.html %}
