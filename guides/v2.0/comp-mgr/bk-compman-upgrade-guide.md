<h2>Getting started with the Component Manager and System Upgrade</h2>   
Magento provides two applications you can use after installing the Magento application to keep it and any installed components up-to-date:

*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/compman-start.html">Component Manager</a>

	Updates *components*, which can be any of the following:

	*	Modules (extend Magento capabilities)
	*	Themes (change the look and feel of your storefront and Admin)
	*	Language packages (localize the storefront and Admin)
	*	Libraries (common code)

	*Update* means updating the component version, uninstalling it, enabling it, or disabling it.

*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/upgrader/upgrade-start.html">System Upgrade</a>

	Upgrade components included with the Magento application.

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
		<p><em>System upgrade</em> refers to updating the Magento 2.x core components and other installed components. To migrate from Magento 1.x to Magento 2, see the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}migration/bk-migration-guide.html">Migration Guide</a>.</p>
