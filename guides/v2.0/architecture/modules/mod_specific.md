Checkout Module

: The Multishipping feature and the Terms and Conditions feature were moved from Checkout module to separate modules. Thus, the third-part developer can disable these functionalities without influencing other parts of the application. Also, the dependencies between decoupled modules and other modules were eliminated or made more explicit.

Catalog Module

: Several features were moved out from Catalog module to separate modules. For instance, configurable product, grouped product, and layered navigation were encapsulated in separate modules.

Sales Module

: The recurring profile feature (also known as recurring payment) was encapsulated in a separate module. Thus, the third-party developer can disable the recurring profile (recurring payment) functionality without influencing other parts of the application. The dependencies between the recurring profile (recurring payment) module and other modules were eliminated or made more explicit.

Apart from decoupling of the recurring profile (recurring payment) feature, the elements related to the Google Checkout functionality were removed (due to its elimination by Google).

As a result of the refactoring, RecurringPayment abstract module was created. This module contains the classes and methods moved out from Sales module as well as relevant elements that ensure using the recurring profile (recurring payment) functionality by the payment methods.

Shipping Module

:	 (https://wiki.magento.com/pages/viewpage.action?title=Working+with+Modules+in+Magento+2+-+DRAFT%2C+DO+NOT+DISTRIBUTE&spaceKey=TEST)Shipping module was also affected by the decoupling changes. The shipping related operations were encapsulated in Shipping module and the shipping methods themselves were moved to separate modules (also known as carrier modules). To decrease dependencies between Shipping module and other modules, the abstract interface module - Carrier - was introduced. The shipping methods' modules interact (and have dependency connection) with Carrier module only. And the latter, in its turn, interacts with other modules within the application, for instance, Product, Sales, RMA, Core, Backend, and so on.

Thus, the carrier modules do not interact with the rest of the application directly and the third-party developer can disable any shipping method without influencing other parts of the application.

Payment Module

: TBD
